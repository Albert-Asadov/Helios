                        <li>
                            A button group is a user interface component that groups multiple buttons together,
                            typically for related actions or options. Button groups are commonly used to present a set
                            of choices or actions to the user in a compact and organized manner. They help improve the
                            visual clarity and efficiency of user interfaces, particularly when there are multiple
                            options to choose from.
                        </li>
                        <li  class="margin">
                            Here are some key characteristics and features of button groups:
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            1. Grouping: Button groups bring together multiple buttons visually, usually by placing them
                            in close proximity to each other. This grouping creates a visual association between the
                            buttons and indicates that they are related.
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            2. Mutual Exclusivity: In certain cases, button groups can enforce mutual exclusivity, where
                            only one button within the group can be selected at a time. This behavior is often used for
                            options like radio buttons or segmented controls.
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            3. Selection State: Button groups typically display the selected or active state of a button
                            to provide visual feedback to the user. The selected button is visually differentiated from
                            the rest, indicating the current choice or active action.
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            4. Action Triggers: Each button within the group represents a specific action or option.
                            Clicking or tapping a button triggers the associated action, such as submitting a form,
                            applying a filter, or switching between different views.
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            5. Styling and Layout: Button groups may have specific styling and layout to visually
                            distinguish them from other elements and ensure they are perceived as a cohesive group.
                            Common styles include placing the buttons within a shared container or applying a background
                            color or border to visually group them together.
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            Button groups can be found in various user interfaces, such as web applications, mobile
                            apps, and desktop software. They are often used in toolbars, navigation menus, settings
                            panels, and form interfaces where multiple actions or choices need to be presented in a
                            compact and organized manner.
                        </li>
                        <li class="margin">
                            Overall, button groups help improve the user experience by providing a clear and structured
                            way for users to interact with multiple related options or actions.
